Jobline is a job application manegment software intendet to make life easier for danish people who are looking for a new job.

WHY MAKE IT? 
ive been unemployend for most of my adult life and know most of the ins and outs of the danish unemployment system with alls its flaws.

Therefore i decited to see if i could build a system with an easy to use interface where you would only have to have one tab open on your browser and aply for any job on the platform with only a few button presses.

I want to make a sysem that makes it easy for the job seaker to document his/hers application and make a statistic over witch applications give the greates yield in terms of job interviews


WHATS IT FOR?

its mainly for my self to improove my abilities as a web developer and to have a bigger project for my portfolio. 
But i fully intend to produce this in my spare time as an aid to people wo look for jobs.
