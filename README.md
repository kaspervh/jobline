WHY MAKE IT?
Jobline is an application that helps unemployed people to organize their job search, and helps them increase their chances to get to the job interview by providing a followup feature, an applied jobs pipeline, statistics about your successes and more.

I am currently unemployed, and it is my experience there are plenty of sites, that facilitates companies to post their jobs. But there are none that helps job seekers, to structure their job search. 

So i decited to see if i could build a system with an easy to use interface that would help both job seekers, case workers and the companies focus on what matters.

Job seekers will have an easier time seesing every opportunity, by going through every job posting and applying with a few clicks, they get reminded when it is time to follow up on the jobs they have applied for and will not have a filled inbox when the company has "decided to go with another candidate"

Case workers will have an easier time getting an overview of the job seekers endeavurs by getting acces to the apllication statistics, so meetings will focused on how to better help the job seeker back on the job market. 

Companys will save valuable time by having a simple 'no thank you button' in the email they recieve when the job seeker applies for a job through jobline.


WHATS IT FOR?
